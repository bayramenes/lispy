This is a repo documenting my journey through the book "Build your own lisp"

In this book we learn how to create a basic interpreter with c and build a lisp using parsers,lexers etc...

i will updating each chapter i commit and i will write down the bonus stuff i did (if any) (NOTE: bonus stuff are things written in the book after each chapter more like an exercise)


I will start documenting from Chapter 6 since chapters before aren't really a thing but more like introduction to C and so on...



CHAPTER 6 BONUS:
1. support for decimal numbers
2. support for the modulo operator
3. changed the grammar from polish notation to conventional notation
